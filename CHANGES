	0.6-0 (10.12.2001)

	release for R-1.4.0

	0.5-9 (08.12.2001)

	map real scores into 1:N for perm.test
	perm.test and wilcox.exact are generic and have a formula interface	
	fixed the most painful documentation bugs

	0.5-7 (06.11.2001)

	asymptotic p-values for perm.test and wilcox.test, coincides with
	StatXact

	0.5-7 (06.11.2001)

	new interface to pperm (computes now all kinds of p.values)
	therefore wilcox.exact and perm.test changed. several minor code-
	and documentation fixes.

	0.5-6 (31.10.2001)

	bugfix in one-sided conf.ints paired wilcox.exact
	examples from Hollander & Wolfe added to wilcox.exact
	check for conf.ints and estimators. 
	R CMD check will only work with R-1.4.0-devel and modified 
	wilcox.exact

	0.5-5 (29.10.2001)

	estimated corrected (PR#1150)

	0.5-4 (27.10.2001)

	pperm has `side' argument: compute P(T <= T) or P(T >= t)

	0.5-3 (25.10.2001)

	perm.test and globulin-example added

	0.5-2 (27.09.2001)

	codoc fixes for R-1.4.0

	0.4-6 (26.06.2001)

	fixed confints, added tests:
	- all.equal(wilcox.exact, wilcox.test)
        - estimator \in confint
        DEPENDS: R(>=1.3.0)

	0.4-5 (09.06.2001)

	Depend broke update.packages -> fixed for R-1.2.3
	!!! REMINDER: change version$minor == "3.0" if R-1.3.0 is out !!!
	added paired Wilcoxon example from StatXact manual, coincides :-)
	
	0.4-3 (07.06.2001)

	moved ./inst/test*.R -> ./tests
	
	0.4-2 (07.06.2001)

	documentation fixed

	0.4-1 (25.05.2001)

	sample estimates as in wilcox.test added to wilcox.exact

	0.4-0 (16.05.2001)

	use eqn. (8.19) from the StatXact manual p. 165 for twosided p-value
	if paired.

	0.3-8 (03.05.2001)

	c++ comments removed from permdist.c

	0.3-7 (12.04.2001)

	pperm2 now computes correct expectation for paired case.
	Now confidence intervals for x - y are computed (as `wilcox.test'
	in R-1.2.3 will do)	

	0.3-6 (20.02.2001)

	typos in cperm.Rd fixed

	0.3-4 (06.01.2001)

	concentrated man pages.

	0.3-3 (20.12.2000)

	added some checks for non-sense parameter configurations. This one
	goes out to CRAN/contrib.

	0.3-2 (18.12.2000)

	added pperm2 which computes two-sided p-values the way StatXact
	does. Added example from StatXact manual page 211 on diastolic blood
	pressure, the results coincied.  

	0.3-1 (17.12.2000)

	renamed "exactDistr" to "exactRankTests" (this is easier to
	pronounce). After a discussion with Kurt last Friday, this version 
	will move to CRAN/contrib. 

	0.2-4 (05.12.2000)

	typos fixed, system.file()[1] in examples 

	0.2-3 (04.12.2000)

	uhh, 0.2-2 was buggy :-(
	bugs (hopefully) fixed, more intelligent determination of the
	factor to multiply real (!) valued scores with. It is now possible
	to give a maximum error by "tol" on the quantile scale. Default is 
	tol = 0.01 which should be ok for most situations. 

	0.2-2 (29.11.2000)

	rational scores now possible -> this results in an approximation
	only. Can be influenced by "fact".

	0.1-9 (25.10.2000)

	bugfixes for pperm(paired): 0 is a possible realization

	0.1-8 (24.10.2000)

	added the paired sample situation, now ./inst/test1.R for the
	comparison with [pq]signrank, ./inst/test2.R with  [pq]wilcox

	0.1-7 (23.10.2000)

	bug fixes (H as double), test.R in ./inst for testing with
	[pq]wilcox

	0.1-6 (22.10.2000)

	hacked cpermdist in C, now computations a lot faster
